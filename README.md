# Introduction

`syncthing-macos` project is a native macOS Syncthing tray application bundle. It bundles its own syncthing instance and wraps [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net), making it behave more like a native macOS application and less like a command-line utility with a web browser interface.

Features include:

 * Open the Syncthing WebGUI from the tray in your system preferred browser.
 * Optionally starts on login, so you don't need to set up Syncthing as a service.
 * Tray icon syncthing status indicator.
 * Retina ready icons for the Application bundle and status tray.
 * Automatic updates (using [Sparkle](https://sparkle-project.org) pushed from github releases).
 * Open shared folders in Finder.
 * Logfile written to `~/Library/Application Support/Syncthing/syncthing.log`, use Finder -> Go -> Go to Folder to open it.

# Installation

**NOTICE**: This is the official Syncthing macOS application bundle. Please make sure you have no other [syncthing instances](https://docs.syncthing.net/users/autostart.html#macos)
            or [wrappers running](https://docs.syncthing.net/users/contrib.html#mac-os) or else this application will not work!

Currently, OS X 10.10 or higher is necessary. **syncthing-macos** is packaged as a disk image as an application bundled with the [syncthing](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing) binary.

To install just download the dmg, mount it and drag and drop the application to install. The only necessary configuration is to set the API key and URL when provisioning a remote syncthing instance, the local instance is auto-configured. The application automatically keeps the syncthing binary updated, while running.

The latest version is available at [Github Releases](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing-macos/releases/latest), or it can also be installed using [homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask) `brew install --cask syncthing`

# Why

All cross-platform approaches are not able to use all the native facilities of macOS. Including auto-updates,
 vector icon set (retina-ready) and creating an application bundle. GUIs are designed with XCode and everything
 is coded in Objective-C and Swift which is "the native approach".

# Goal

The goal of this project is to keep the Native macOS Syncthing tray as simple as possible. No graphs, no advanced configuration
 windows. It just provides a very simple wrapper so users are not aware syncthing ships as a commandline application. It strives to have a usability of good-by-default and should always follow the [Apple Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos) to feel as much as an native application as possible.

# FAQ: Frequently asked questions

## macOS version support

* From release v1.14.0-1 macOS 10.12 is required
* Until release [v1.13.1-1](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing-macos/releases/tag/v1.13.1-1) macOS 10.11 or higher is supported

## Preferences

syncthing-macos is designed to run its own syncthing instance and automatically detect the API key. The preferences window is used to point to a
local running instance, a remote instance is not supported. It is possible to run your own instance and point to it for advanced/development purposes. You
should only change the settings if you know what you are doing.

Setting extra syncthing commandline parameters is a hidden feature. You need to write these using the application defaults configuration.
The only current limitation the parameters cannot contain spaces!.
In the example below the audit log is enabled:

```
defaults write com.github.xor-gate.syncthing-macosx Arguments '--audit --auditfile=/Users/JohnDoe/staudit.log'
```

## Default IP address change

When the default IP address is changed from 127.0.0.1 to a routable one like e.g 192.168.1.102 the tray application
preferences need to be set also. Or else the API cannot be accessed and will stay 'Offline'. If you broke the
configuration you can manually edit the file under the `~/Library/Application Support/Syncthing/config.xml` using
Finder with Go -> Go to folder. And restart the syncthing service from the tray.

## Uninstallation

On Mac OS X you drop the application from the Application folder to your Trash. 
But there are some user specific files are kept elsewhere, which are located under 
`$HOME/Library/Application Support/Syncthing`. The files in this folder are the configuration,
encryption/profile files and the database cache. For more information see [docs.syncthing.net/users/config.html](https://docs.syncthing.net/users/config.html#description).

# Prerequisites for building/using everything in this repository

Before compiling git submodules needs to be present:

```
git submodule update --init
```

- Xcode, for the Objective-C/Swift compiler
- Python 3, for the update-release.py script
  - Needs [semver](https://pypi.org/project/semver/) from pip
- Cocoapods for updating Objective-C/Swift 3th party dependencies
- Golang, only needed for Sparkle Github releases to Appcast XML tool

# Using XCode

The new `syncthing.xcworkspace` must be used when coding in XCode. The old `syncthing.xcodeproj` is deprecated.

# Compiling from Terminal

Build with XCode or run:

```
make debug
```

It will automaticly download syncthing universal binary and add it to the Application Bundle.

For release builds signing the application build and creating an distributable DMG:

```
make release-dmg
```

The script will select the first available Developer ID and sign the app with it. To specify the signing identity, use `SYNCTHING_APP_CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY` environment variable:

```
SYNCTHING_APP_CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="Mac Developer: foo@bar.com (XB59MXU8EC)" make release-dmg
```

# Design and useful information

## Settings

The Syncthing settings use the NSDefaults facility. From the commandline all settings can be shown with:

```
jerry@Jerrys-iMac ~ % defaults read com.github.xor-gate.syncthing-macosx
{
    ApiKey = rR7YrEDLKhNETJZKgySmnYPZvebY9qgk;
    Executable = "/Applications/Syncthing.app/Contents/Resources/syncthing/syncthing";
    SUEnableAutomaticChecks = 1;
    SUHasLaunchedBefore = 1;
    SULastCheckTime = "2021-01-08 12:05:53 +0000";
    SUSendProfileInfo = 0;
    StartAtLogin = 1;
    URI = "http://127.0.0.1:8384";
}
```

## Dependency management

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) is used for dependency management. It can be installed with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager. For more information about CocoaPods read the [CocoaPods Guides](https://guides.cocoapods.org/).

## Versioning scheme

It uses the shipped syncthing executable version appended with a `-<build index>` number.
So for Syncthing `0.14.28` with first build/package it is versioned as `0.14.28-1`.
Currently there is no need for having a separate version for `syncthing-macos`. As it also keeps the wrapper tightly coupled with the syncthing releases.

## Compilation and packaging process

* Xcode builds all sources
* Syncthing resource is fetched with `syncthing/Scripts/syncthing-resource.sh`
* Fancy DMG disk image is generated with `syncthing/Scripts/create-dmg.sh`
  * The version part of the DMG name is fetched from `syncthing/Info.plist, key CFBundleShortVersionString`
* Both the app bundle and the DMG are signed with the first available Developer ID certificate, if found (or the one specified through `SYNCTHING_APP_CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY` environment variable)

`syncthing/syncthing-macos` will only ship [stable releases and no release candidates](https://forum.syncthing.net/t/introducing-stable-releases-and-release-candidates/9167) of the Syncthing Service (daemon).

## Apple Application Notarize

After the dmg is created it must be send to Apple to be notarized. It can be checked with spctl if the app is correctly verified by Apple for distribution:

```
spctl -a -t exec -vvv /Volumes/Syncthing/Syncthing.app
/Volumes/Syncthing/Syncthing.app: accepted
source=Notarized Developer ID
origin=Developer ID Application: Jakob Borg (LQE5SYM783)
```

When it is not correctly notarized the following output is seen (note the source):

```
spctl -a -t exec -vvv /Volumes/Syncthing/Syncthing.app
/Volumes/Syncthing/Syncthing.app: accepted
source=Developer ID
origin=Developer ID Application: Jakob Borg (LQE5SYM783)
```

See also <https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/notarizing_macos_software_before_distribution>

## New release

To update the bundled syncthing the `make release-update` must be run from the main folder which does
basicly these steps automatically:
* Update `syncthing/Scripts/syncthing-resource.sh`, `SYNCTHING_VERSION`
* Update `syncthing/Info.plist`
  * `CFBundleShortVersionString` (e.g `0.14.50-dev` or `0.14.50-1`)
  * `CFBundleVersion` (e.g `145000` or `145001`)

* Manually create a github release
* Download the release dmg from [build.syncthing.net](https://build.syncthing.net/viewType.html?buildTypeId=SyncthingMacOS_BuildReleaseDmg) which is correctly signed and notarized
